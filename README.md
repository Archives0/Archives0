### Welcome to my page!

My name is Lynne Gonzalez and I love making video games! I created my first game using Scratch at the age of 11 and was enamored by the process and ultimately getting to see people play what I had made. While in college studying Environmental Science, I decided to get serious about making games and taught myself the basics of the Unity engine. I joined the University of Iowa's game development club and swiftly became an executive member, helping to teach other students basic skills for game development such as programming and design. 

My proficiency in game engines and dedication to game development soon had me recognized by the University of Iowa Hydroinformatics Lab, and I was given the opportunity to join the lab as a graduate research assistant developing immersive flood visualizations and serious games. As my studies in Human-Computer Interaction near a close, I am incredibly excited to be entering the next stage of my development career!

When I'm not working on games, I enjoy making music, creative writing, reading fantasy novels, and playing roleplaying games!
