### Welcome to my page!

I am a game developer specialized in game design, UI, and gameplay scripting.

My journey into game development began with the classic ttrpg Dungeons & Dragons, where I regularly create mechanics and adventures for my friends to enjoy. My deep love for roleplaying games naturally combined with my love for programming, and I began working to turn my tabletop adventures into a digital reality.

There is a line I had read years ago that has continued to stick with me. On the back of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion reads the tag, "Live another life in another world." This phrase fuels my ambition to build compelling, beautiful worlds and motivates me to constantly improve as a developer.

I currently work as a graduate researcher at the University of Iowa's Hydroinformatics Lab where I have the privilege of creating serious games to improve public engagement and comprehension of flood risks and processes.
